**_A generally important note:_** every book I&#8217;ve written (or co-written) is available as a free .PDF on the book&#8217;s website, in addition to being available for sale in bookstores/[online][1]. I do this to prevent money from being a barrier for education, so please don&#8217;t feel bad about taking advantage of this if it&#8217;s what you need/want. You cannot steal my books: I&#8217;ve already gifted them to you.

## A Guide to Gender

Currently in its 2nd Edition, [A Guide to Gender: The Social Justice Advocate&#8217;s Handbook][3] has been the #1 in a bunch of categories on Amazon, and has become the textbook for lots of gender studies courses, despite me having a subheading in the book stating &#8220;This is not a textbook.&#8221;

I released the second edition in 2017, updating it five years after its initial publication with a couple new chapters, and lots of revised language.

I wrote it with a particular someone in mind: a lay person who was curious about gender, and wanted to learn more about it, from a socially just perspective.

You can read more about it, download it, or find lots of links to purchase it, on the book&#8217;s website, [www.guidetogender.com][3].

## Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation

[Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation: 11 Key Concepts You Didn&#8217;t Know You Didn&#8217;t Know][4] is the first book I co-authored with Meg Bolger. We wrote it with a narrow audience in mind: specifically, to give to our train-the-trainer participants, filling in gaps on things we never had time to cover.

Since it came out, we&#8217;ve been hearing that it&#8217;s perfect for just about anyone who leads groups in process &#8212; facilitators, teachers, meeting organizers, team leaders, etc. A high school teacher let us know it&#8217;s the book they&#8217;re using as the textbook for their peer facilitators. An outdoor educator told us it&#8217;s one of the books they give to new trainees.

It&#8217;s short and snappy (weighing in at around 150 pages), with actionable advice in each chapter. You can view the 11 concepts on the book&#8217;s website, [www.facilitationmagic.com][4].

[Advocating Creatively: Stories of Contemporary Social Change Pioneers][5], edited by Natalie A. Millman, is a book I was asked to contribute a chapter to. It&#8217;s a fun read, with a diverse authorship, where no two chapters are alike.

From the blurb:

&#8220;The purpose of this project is to compile a set of personal essays, contributed by contemporary social change pioneers who practice creative methods of advocacy to advance social justice, equality, and peace. Inspired by _Days in the Lives of Social Workers_ by Linda May Grobman, this book is intended to provide inspiration to individuals interested in creative advocacy and activism, to create a broader sense of community between current practitioners of creative advocacy and activism, and foster greater recognition in the wider professional world of creative advocacy and activism practice.&#8221;

## How I Got Into Sex&#8230; Ed

<div class="wp-block-image" style="max-width: 50%; float: left; margin: 5% 5% 5% 0;">
  <figure class="alignright is-resized"><a href="https://www.sexedstore.com/how-i-got-into-sex-ed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.samk.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/How-I-Got-Into-Sex-Ed-cover-643x1024.jpg" alt="" class="shadow-high wp-image-1055 lazy-load" width="300" height="450" /></a></figure>
</div>

[How I Got into Sex Ed][6], edited by Karen Rayne, is an anthology of over 60 essays from sexuality educators in the field, this book differs from all other CSE publications.

I contributed an essay, along with lots of my friends and sex ed heroes. The essays vary dramatically in tone, theme, and trajectory in such a way that anyone considering sex ed as a profession or passion can see themselves in this text.

It&#8217;s only available for sale (I believe) directly from the Center for Sex Education, so you&#8217;ll need [this link][6] if you want a copy.
